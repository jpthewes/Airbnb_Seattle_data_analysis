## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python 3 and requires some additional libraries. For the installation of these, you can run:
` pip3 install -r requirements.txt `
Afterwards you can just execute the `analysis.py` script and enjoy the data analysis results in the command line.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in the following questions after taking a look at the availbale Airbnb Data from Seattle:

1. What are the key factors determining the price of the appartments?
2. Will I be happier if I spend those extra dollars for the upgrade?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

**analysis.py**: Python script doing the data analysis </br>
**data/**: Seattle's Airbnb data files  </br>
**images/**: Images to have a glance at the data </br>

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jpthewes/understanding-airbnb-prices-and-how-they-make-you-happy-294c10b87099).
